# Brief description of Pandas
Pandas library is excellent at representing and ingeting CSV, Excel, or list/dictionaries of data, and quickly being able to generate stats with it. These methods are all builtin, resulting in much less code to write. I honestly wish I had known about this library earlier in my career, as it would have saved lots of trouble parsing CSV files, and performing mathematical functions.
# Plots
The plot methods through the matplotlib.pyplot are seriously next level. Through using IDLE, I haven't been able to figure out how to display them inline in the output without popping out a new window, but it's still cool to be able to quickly visualize your data.
